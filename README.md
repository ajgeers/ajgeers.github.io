Personal website generated by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) using the default [Primer](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer) theme. 

I made some small changes to the theme by modifying `_layouts/default.html` from the [Primer repo](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer) and by overriding/adding CSS styles in `_sass/custom.scss`, which gets imported by `assets/css/style.scss`.

Thanks to [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.org), [Vladimir Agafonkin](https://agafonkin.com), and [Luca Antiga](http://lantiga.github.io) for the inspiration to keep the site fast and simple.
