I am a Senior Engineering Manager at [Planet](https://www.planet.com).

After studying Physics at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl), I did a PhD in Computational Biomedicine at the [Pompeu Fabra University](https://www.upf.edu/en/) in Barcelona. My research focused on the modeling of blood flow in brain arteries and understanding the role of blood flow in the development and treatment of aneurysms. [Here is a list of my publications](publications.md).

I then joined an Earth Observation startup in Edinburgh, where I led a team of software developers and data scientists. We built solutions that helped our users gain insight from satellite imagery and other geospatial data to monitor and intervene in natural and human-made disasters.

After spending a year traveling through South America and Japan, I returned to the Netherlands and joined VanderSat as a Software Engineer, where I contributed to the development of satellite data products used in agriculture, hydrological modeling,  index-based insurances, and more. Following the acquisition by Planet, I transitioned to the role of Engineering Manager and now lead a team responsible for climate and water solutions.
