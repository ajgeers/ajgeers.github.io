I am a researcher, software developer, and data scientist. I have just returned from a year of traveling through South America and Japan, and I'm currently looking for opportunities in The Netherlands.

After studying Physics, I did a PhD in Biomedical Engineering. My research focused on computational modeling of blood flow in brain arteries and understanding the role of blood flow in the development and treatment of aneurysms. [Here is a list of my publications](publications.md).

For the last few years, I led a team of software developers and data scientists at an Earth Observation startup. Together, we built solutions that helped our users gain insight from satellite imagery and other geospatial data to monitor and intervene in natural and human-made disasters. I worked in many aspects of product development, from user research to data analysis to web development.
